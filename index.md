*I am looking for Ph.D. students in the data center, cloud, and large-scale
storage area. If you are an admitted or current University of Utah CS student
feel free to contact me. Otherwise, apply to the [Utah SoC PhD
program](http://www.cs.utah.edu).*

I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/)
at the [University of Utah](http://www.utah.edu/).
My interests include Distributed Systems,
Operating Systems, and Databases.  I'm passionate about designing and building
systems that allow large-scale applications to access data more intensively
than has been possible in the past.  My dissertation work,
[Fast Crash Recovery in RAMCloud]
(http://www.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/ramcloud-recovery.pdf)
provides durability and availability in a large-scale distributed DRAM-based
storage system with the same price and energy consumption as today's volatile
caches.  Overall, it enables the use of DRAM as fault-tolerant large-scale data
center storage which is 50 to 5000 times faster than other data center storage
systems.

Formerly, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
[databases group](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/db/) at
[Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/).
Before that, I earned my Ph.D. at Stanford University working as a part of the
[RAMCloud](https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/) and the
[Secure Computer Systems](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/) lab</a>.
 

# <a name="projects"></a> Projects

## Current

 - [Deuteronomy](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/db/) - A fully lock-free
   transactional database engine that is performance competitive with modern
   in-memory databases. Deuteronomy maintains clean architectural separation of
   storage, indexing, and transaction components for flexible 
   deployment in embedded, cloud, or data center systems.
 - [RAMCloud](http://ramcloud.stanford.edu/) - A high-performance distributed
   key-value storage system designed with latency goals to enable the next
   generation of data center applications.

## Past

 - [Cinder](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/cinder) - An operating system designed
   for cellular phones and mobile devices with fine-grained energy accounting,
    allocation, subdivision, and delegation.
 - [HiStar](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/histar) - An operating system designed
   around decentralized information flow control.
 - [ROSE](http://www.rosecompiler.org/) - A source-to-source compiler
   infrastructure for transformation and analysis tools for large-scale
   applications.
 - [AutoTest](http://autotest.github.com/) - A release-driven Linux kernel
   regression testing framework.
 - [Lost in Translation](./stego/) - A steganographic system that hides information in
   natural language translations.
